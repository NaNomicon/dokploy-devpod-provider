## Summary

This release transforms the Dokploy DevPod provider from a basic proof-of-concept into a production-ready, high-performance solution. The switch to Alpine Linux provides dramatic performance improvements, while the automated SSH port mapping eliminates manual configuration steps. Comprehensive debugging and user-friendly error messages make the provider reliable and easy to troubleshoot.

The provider now successfully handles the inherent Docker Swarm port mapping delays and provides clear communication to users about expected behavior, resulting in a much better user experience overall.
