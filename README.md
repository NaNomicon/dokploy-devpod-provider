# Dokploy DevPod Provider

A high-performance DevPod provider for [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) that enables seamless development environment creation and management through Dokploy's container orchestration platform.

## üöÄ Features

- **‚ö° Fast Deployment**: Uses Alpine Linux for 6x faster package installation
- **üîß Automatic SSH Setup**: Intelligent port mapping and SSH configuration
- **üê≥ Docker Swarm Integration**: Native Dokploy/Docker Swarm compatibility
- **üõ†Ô∏è Zero Configuration**: Automatic project and application management
- **üìä Comprehensive Debugging**: Detailed logging and error analysis
- **üîÑ DevPod Compatible**: Full support for `.devcontainer.json` workflows

## üìã Prerequisites

- [DevPod CLI](https://devpod.sh/) installed
- Access to a Dokploy instance
- Dokploy API token (generate from Settings > Profile > API/CLI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Provider

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dokploy-devpod-provider
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file with your Dokploy credentials:

```bash
# Required
DOKPLOY_SERVER_URL=https://your-dokploy-instance.com
DOKPLOY_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# Optional
DOKPLOY_PROJECT_NAME=devpod-workspaces
DOKPLOY_SERVER_ID=your-server-id  # For multi-server setups
MACHINE_TYPE=small
```

### 3. Install Provider

```bash
make install-local
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Create a Workspace from Git Repository

```bash
devpod up https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git --provider dokploy-dev
```

### Create a Workspace from Local Directory

```bash
devpod up ./my-project --provider dokploy-dev
```

### Connect to Existing Workspace

```bash
devpod ssh my-workspace
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Important: Docker Swarm Port Mapping Delay

**Expected Behavior**: When creating a new workspace, you'll see a 60+ second delay during SSH setup. This is **normal and expected** behavior.

### Why This Happens

Dokploy uses Docker Swarm for container orchestration. When the provider creates SSH port mappings, Docker Swarm needs time to propagate these mappings across the cluster. This process typically takes 60-120 seconds.

### What You'll See

```
üéâ SSH port mapping configured successfully!
   Using port: 2222

‚ÑπÔ∏è  NOTICE: Docker Swarm Port Mapping Delay
   Dokploy uses Docker Swarm for container orchestration, which requires
   time for port mappings to propagate across the cluster. This 60+ second
   delay is normal and expected behavior, not a provider issue.

   ‚Ä¢ Port mapping API: ‚úÖ Completed successfully
   ‚Ä¢ Port propagation: ‚è≥ In progress (60-120 seconds typical)
   ‚Ä¢ SSH accessibility: ‚è≥ Will be available after propagation

DEBUG: Sleeping for 60 seconds to allow Dokploy port mapping to propagate...
```

### This is NOT a Bug

- ‚úÖ The provider is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Port mapping was created successfully
- ‚è≥ Docker Swarm is propagating the mapping
- üéØ SSH will be accessible once propagation completes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### DevPod Two-Layer Architecture

The provider works with DevPod's two-layer architecture:

1. **Layer 1 (Infrastructure)**: Alpine Linux container with SSH access
   - Managed by this Dokploy provider
   - Provides the base environment and SSH connectivity
2. **Layer 2 (Development Environment)**: Your actual development tools
   - Managed by DevPod agent
   - Installs Node.js, Python, Docker, etc. based on your `.devcontainer.json`

## üîß Configuration Options

| Option                 | Description                       | Default             | Required |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `DOKPLOY_SERVER_URL`   | Your Dokploy server URL           | -                   | ‚úÖ       |
| `DOKPLOY_API_TOKEN`    | API token from Dokploy            | -                   | ‚úÖ       |
| `DOKPLOY_PROJECT_NAME` | Project name for workspaces       | `devpod-workspaces` | ‚ùå       |
| `DOKPLOY_SERVER_ID`    | Server ID for multi-server        | -                   | ‚ùå       |
| `MACHINE_TYPE`         | Machine size (small/medium/large) | `small`             | ‚ùå       |
| `AGENT_PATH`           | DevPod agent installation path    | `/opt/devpod/agent` | ‚ùå       |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Application not found" Error

- **Cause**: Application was deleted from Dokploy dashboard
- **Solution**: Delete the workspace and recreate it

#### 2. SSH Connection Timeout

- **Cause**: Port mapping still propagating
- **Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes and try again

#### 3. "Port already in use" Error

- **Cause**: Previous workspace using the same port
- **Solution**: Delete unused workspaces or wait for automatic cleanup

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed debugging:

```bash
devpod up <source> --provider dokploy-dev --debug
```

### Manual SSH Connection

If automated SSH fails, connect manually:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 devpod@your-dokploy-host.com
# Password: devpod
```

## üìä Performance

### Deployment Speed

- **Alpine Linux**: ~5 seconds for package installation
- **Ubuntu (previous)**: 30+ seconds for package installation
- **Improvement**: 6x faster deployment

### Resource Usage

- **Base Image**: Alpine Linux (~5MB)
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead
- **CPU**: Efficient container startup
